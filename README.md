### CyberGuard Academy 

A gamified cybersecurity awareness platform built for hackathon constraints, designed to educate users about cybersecurity through interactive games, simulations, and hands-on learning experiences.

Project Overview

CyberGuard Academy is an educational cybersecurity platform that transforms complex security concepts into engaging, interactive experiences. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this platform addresses critical cybersecurity awareness gaps through gamification and practical simulations.

### Hackathon Tracks Addressed

This project successfully addresses three challenging hackathon tracks:

### Track 2: 2G Connection Ninja 
- **Ultra-lightweight design**: Optimized assets 
- **Compressed resources**: Minified CSS/JS 
- **Progressive loading**: Critical content loads first, non-essential features load progressively

### Track 3: Ancient Hardware Whisperer 
- **Low memory footprint**: Efficient JavaScript with minimal DOM manipulation
- **CPU-friendly animations**: CSS-based animations with hardware acceleration
- **Optimized rendering**: Minimal reflows and repaints

### Track 4: Grandma's Digital Sage
- **Radical simplicity**: A clear interface and uncluttered that it requires zero onboarding or documentation.
- **Guided flow**: Minimal choices, and forgiving error handling so mistakes feel safe.
- **Delightful wisdom**: An experience that empowers users to feel like experts instantly, with no manuals, just intuition.
