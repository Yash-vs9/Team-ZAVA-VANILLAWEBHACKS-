### CyberGuard Academy 

A gamified cybersecurity awareness platform built for hackathon constraints, designed to educate users about cybersecurity through interactive games, simulations, and hands-on learning experiences.

Project Overview

CyberGuard Academy is an educational cybersecurity platform that transforms complex security concepts into engaging, interactive experiences. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this platform addresses critical cybersecurity awareness gaps through gamification and practical simulations.

### Hackathon Tracks Addressed

This project successfully addresses three challenging hackathon tracks:

### Track 2: 2G Connection Ninja 
- **Ultra-lightweight design**: Optimized assets 
- **Compressed resources**: Minified CSS/JS 
- **Progressive loading**: Critical content loads first, non-essential features load progressively

### Track 3: Ancient Hardware Whisperer 
- **Low memory footprint**: Efficient JavaScript with minimal DOM manipulation
- **CPU-friendly animations**: CSS-based animations with hardware acceleration
- **Optimized rendering**: Minimal reflows and repaints

### Track 7: Offline Survivalist 
- **Service Worker implementation**: Full offline functionality
- **Local storage**: Progress and achievements saved locally
- **Cached resources**: All assets available offline after first visit
- **No external dependencies**: Self-contained with no CDN requirements
